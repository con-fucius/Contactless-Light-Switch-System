# Smart-lights-node-mcu
Project revolves around automating switching on lights remotely using the telegram bot and node mcu

## PROJECT STATEMENT
The need for safe health practices such as using sanitizers after using public amenities like taps,doors or switches is very essential to reduce  spread of COVID-19. Therefore there is an immediate need in the innovation involving touch free triggers to facilitate actions such as activating taps, doors and switches.

## SPECIFICATIONS
 ### ESP 8266 NODEMCU
   -2.4 GHz Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n, supporting WPA/WPA2).
   -General-purpose input/output (16 GPIO).
   -Inter-Integrated Circuit (I²C) serial communication protocol.
   -Analog-to-digital conversion (10-bit ADC).
   -Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) serial communication protocol.
   -I²S (Inter-IC Sound) interfaces with DMA(Direct Memory Access) (sharing pins with GPIO).
   -UART (on dedicated pins, plus a transmit-only UART can be enabled on GPIO2).
   -Pulse-width modulation (PWM).
   -It employs a 32-bit RISC CPU (reduced instruction set computer) based on the Tensilica Xtensa L106 running at 80 MHz (or overclocked to 160 MHz).
   -It has a 64 KB boot ROM, 64 KB instruction RAM, and 96 KB data RAM. External flash memory can be accessed through SPI.

 ### Photocell
   -Photocell is ½” diameter CdS (cadmium-sulfide). 
   -Universal 120-277 AC voltage (50-60Hz) is standard.
   -Preset 3 to 10 second time-delay prevents unintended switching due to momentary flashes of light. 
   -Power consumption: 2 watts.
   
 ### greenled
   -1.8-2.2VDC forward drop.
   -Max current: 20mA.
   -Suggested using current: 16-18mA.
   -Luminous Intensity: 150-200mcd.
   
 ### HC-SRO4 Ultrasonic sensor
   -Working Voltage: DC 5V
   -Working Current: 15mA
   -Working Frequency: 40Hz
   -Min Range: 2cm, Max Range: 4m
   -Measuring Angle: 15°.
